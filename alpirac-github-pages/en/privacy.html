      <h1>Privacy Policy — Alpirac</h1>
      <p>Last updated: October 27, 2025</p>
      <p>This policy explains how the Alpirac app collects and uses your data. It applies when you use the iOS/iPadOS app and its associated services.</p>

      <h2>Data controller</h2>
      <p>Developer / publisher: Julien Pulhuj
Contact email: julien.pul@icloud.com</p>

      <h2>1) Data we process</h2>
      <p>Account identifiers (via Sign in with Apple): stable identifier provided by Apple, name and email (possibly via “Hide My Email” relay).
Location and route: GPS position, altitude/barometer, speed, heading, activity tracks (GPS points), distance and duration.
Activity data: activity type (hiking, climbing, etc.), segments, statistics (elevation ±, pace, average speed, etc.).
Health (HealthKit) (only if you allow it): writing and/or reading activity data (calories, heart rate, workouts) to export activities to Apple Health and/or estimate certain measures.
Diagnostics: crash logs and anonymized usage data to improve the app.
Alpirac does not sell your data and does not perform advertising profiling.</p>

      <h2>2) Purposes and legal bases (GDPR)</h2>
      <p>Provide app features (activity recording, maps, CloudKit sync) — performance of a contract.
HealthKit export or reading — explicit consent, withdrawable anytime in the Health app.
Geolocation for activity tracking — consent.
Improvement and security (diagnostics, fraud prevention) — legitimate interest.
Legal obligations — legal obligation.</p>

      <h2>3) Where is your data stored?</h2>
      <p>On your device.
In iCloud/CloudKit (Apple) when sync is enabled (account, activities, metadata). The infrastructure is provided by Apple; we do not operate our own servers for this data.
HealthKit data: never on our servers. It remains on your device and, if applicable, in iCloud depending on your settings.</p>

      <h2>4) Sharing and processors</h2>
      <p>Apple (CloudKit, App Store, crash diagnostics): hosting and system analytics.
No other sharing with third parties, except when required by law.</p>

      <h2>5) Retention periods</h2>
      <p>Account and activities: as long as your account is active, then deletion and/or anonymization within a reasonable period (up to 24 months) after inactivity or an erasure request.
Diagnostics: up to 12 months.
HealthKit: managed by iOS / the Health app — you control history and deletion.</p>

      <h2>6) Your rights (EU / GDPR)</h2>
      <p>You have the rights of access, rectification, erasure, restriction, portability, and objection, as well as the right to set post-mortem directives.

To exercise your rights: email julien.pul@icloud.com from the address associated with your Alpirac account.

Revoke Sign in with Apple: Apple ID Settings &gt; Password &amp; Security &gt; Apps Using Apple ID.
Manage Health permissions: Settings &gt; Health &gt; Apps &gt; Alpirac.
Manage location: Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Location Services &gt; Alpirac.</p>

      <h2>7) Security</h2>
      <p>We apply appropriate technical and organizational measures. As no method is infallible, protect access to your device and your iCloud account.</p>

      <h2>8) Minors</h2>
      <p>Alpirac is intended for a general audience. Minors’ accounts must be created with the consent and under the control of the parental authority holder, where applicable.</p>

      <h2>9) Changes to this policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this policy. The update date is shown at the top of the document. In case of major changes, information will be provided in the app.</p>
